# TetrisCV

With the help of alexnet and neural networks I analized the raw pixel data of a tetris game to create a more general A.I. By only feeding in the lines cleared and the pixel data of the game play the A.I has to make a lot of generalizations about what it means to play and a be successfull Tetris player. 

# Note:

This is still a work in progess, still need to optimize the unsupervised learning process.
